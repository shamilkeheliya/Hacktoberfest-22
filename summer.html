    <p>summer, warmest season of the year, between spring and autumn. 
      In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually defined as the period 
      between the summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22, 
      and the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), 
      September 22 or 23; and in the Southern Hemisphere, as the period 
      between December 22 or 23 and March 20 or 21. The temperature contrast 
      between summer and the other seasons exists only in middle and high latitudes;
      temperatures in the equatorial regions generally vary little from month to month.
      For physical causes of the seasons, see season. The season everyone loves.

      The concept of summer in European languages is associated with growth and maturity,
      especially that of cultivated plants, and indeed summer is the season of
      greatest plant growth in regions with sufficient summer rainfall.
      Festivals and rites have been used in many cultures to celebrate summer in
      recognition of its importance in food production.</p>
